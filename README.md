# Customer Churn Prediction System

## üìå Overview
A machine learning system that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Real-time churn probability prediction**
- **ANN model with 86% accuracy**
- **User-friendly web interface**
- **Automated data preprocessing**
- **Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance**
